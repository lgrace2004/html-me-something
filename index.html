                <h2>Chapter 1 </h2>
    <p> Once upon a time there was a sad and lonely dog named Pete. </p></h1>
    <p> Pete was really a pretty cool dog. If you walked into Pete's house he
        would jump up and try to lick you to death. Good if you were having a bad day,
        or if you wanted to rid your face of any extra crumbs.</p>

    <p> There was a reason, however, that Pete got so excited to see visitors.</p>
    <p> PETE WAS LONELY.</p>
    <p> I mean, who could blame him? His owners loved him to pieces, but that dog
        needed ANOTHER DOG. A playmate. A packmate. A soulmate!</p>
    <p> So, what to do? What would you do if you were Pete?
        He couldn't talk to his family. He didn't know English.</p>
      <p>He couldn't talk to the cat. He didn't want his nose to get scratched.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p> BUT! There was someone who would understand him.... </p>
    <p> LEO. The dog next door.</p>
    <p> LEO spoke Doglish. LEO would not scratch his nose. LEO would lick and
        jump and play and run....with only one problem.</p>
    <p> LEO was on the other side of a fence. A big, tall, sturdy fence. Peter could
        hear Leo, he could smell him, he could even see him through the boards. But Pete <head>
            never yet tried to get to Leo.</p>

    <h2> Chapter 3 </h2>
    <p> Let's help Pete, what do you say?</p>
    <p> Let's bring Pete outside! Let's open the gate! Let's bring Pete
        inside....Leo-Land! </p>
    <p> LOOK AT THEM GO! JUMP PLAY FETCH CHASE ROLL BARK GO NUTS!!!!!</p>
    <img src = "images/2-dogs-playing-in-grass.jpg" alt = "uh oh"/>
    <p> Thank you, you nice person! You just made Pete's life worth living. and
        you didn't exactly hurt Leo's life either!
