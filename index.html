                        <p class = "para"> Once upon a time there was a sad and lonely dog named Pete. </p></h1>
                        <p class = "para"> Pete was really a pretty cool dog. If you walked into Pete's house he
                            would jump up and try to lick you to death. Good if you were having a bad day,
                            or if you wanted to rid your face of any extra crumbs.</p>

                        <p class = "para"> I mean, who could blame him? His owners loved him to pieces, but that dog
                            needed ANOTHER DOG. A playmate. A packmate. A soulmate!</p>
                        <p class = "para"> So, what to do? What would you do if you were Pete?
                            He couldn't talk to his family. He didn't know English.</p>
                        <p class = "para">He couldn't talk to the cat. He didn't want his nose to get <span id="unique">scratched<span>.</p>

                        hear Leo, he could smell him, he could even see him through the boards. But Pete <head>
                        never yet tried to get to Leo.</p>
